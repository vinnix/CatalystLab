Catalyst Advent Calendar 2007 day 1 and day 14.
This is the supporting Catalyst ExtJS sample application.
Please read those articles in association with this code.

Run script/extjs_server.pl to test the application.

The code includes below root/static/ext-1.1.1 a cut down version
of the ext-1.1.1 library so this app will work if the reader
forgets to install ExtJS. A lot of the examples and the manuals
have been removed so you'd be better off downloading it from
the extjs.com site as described in the day 1 article.
